## outline
Wanting to learn more about programming and math and seeing how Andre Michelle explored Flash Player with his Flash Player Labratory, I created this series of programming experiments to explore various concepts about both! All toys, simulations, algorithms etc. are made entirely by me with javascript using Phaser for graphics. All projects are filed under the respective type with each project folder containing all of the functions, classes, and scene code required to replicate them yourself! To be honest as far as skiddying goes I don't really care if you steal my code as im doing this to learn just don't monetize it (who knows maybe you'll learn something from it).
